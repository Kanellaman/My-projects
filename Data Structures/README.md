# Data-Structures

This folder contains my very first projects (assignments) in C while I was in my 1st semester in Uni.
The 3 assignments folders are the 3 "big" tasks I did while studying the subject [Data Structures and Programming Techniques](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~k08/). Every folder contains the exercise pronunciation of each assignment.
